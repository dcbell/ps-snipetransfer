NOTES:
    Make sure you run Initialize-SnipeConnection before using other cmdlets.
    
    References to IDs (asset IDs, User IDs, etc.) are references to the database IDs. You can find these in the URL when looking at a user, asset, etc. This is **NOT** the asset tag or the username.

    Get-Help is available on all cmdlets to provide more information and specific syntax.
